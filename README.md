# Open LoRaWAN Modem for Murata Type ABZ Module

The aim of this project is to develop open source LoRaWAN modem for the [Type ABZ](https://github.com/hardwario/lora-modem-abz/wiki/Type-ABZ-Modules) wireless module by Murata. The firmware provides an AT command interface backward compatible with Murata Modem, Murata's proprietary LoRaWAN firmware. The firmware can be used on all Type ABZ variants with an open (user-reprogrammable) microcontroller. Binary firmware images are provided for HARDWARIO [LoRa Module](https://shop.hardwario.com/lora-module/), Arduino [MKR WAN 1300](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-wan-1300-lora-connectivity), and [MKR WAN 1310](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-wan-1310) boards.

## Main Features 

* Support for [LoRaWAN 1.0.4](https://resources.lora-alliance.org/technical-specifications/ts001-1-0-4-lorawan-l2-1-0-4-specification), [LoRaWAN 1.1](https://resources.lora-alliance.org/technical-specifications/lorawan-specification-v1-1), and regional parameters [RP2-1.0.3](https://resources.lora-alliance.org/technical-specifications/rp2-1-0-3-lorawan-regional-parameters)
* Based on the most recent version (unreleased 4.7.0) of [LoRaMac-node](https://github.com/Lora-net/LoRaMac-node)
* Support for multiple regions configurable at runtime
* All persistent LoRaWAN MAC data stored in NVM (EEPROM)

[A note on LoRaWAN 1.1 compatibility](https://github.com/hardwario/lora-modem-abz/wiki/LoRaWAN-1.1-Compatibility)

The project also provides a [Python library and command line tool](./python) for managing TypeABZ LoRa modems. See this [README](./python/README.md) for more information.

## Building

You will need the the embedded gcc toolchain for ARM (arm-none-eabi), git, and make to build the firmware from the source code. First, clone the repository and initialize git submodules:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hardwario/lora-modem-abz
cd lora-modem-abz
git submodule update --init
```
If you wish to customize the build, edit the variables at the beginning of the Makefile. Next, build the firmware in release mode:
```sh
make release
```
If you wish to build a development version with logging and debugging enabled, run `make debug` instead. Running `make` without any arguments builds the development version by default. *Please note that development builds have higher [idle power consumption](https://github.com/hardwario/lora-modem-abz/wiki/Power-Consumption) than release builds.*

## Installation
Follow the steps outlined in this [wiki page](https://github.com/hardwario/lora-modem-abz/wiki/LoRa-Module-Firmware-Replacement) to replace the proprietary firmware in HARDWARIO's [LoRa Module](https://shop.hardwario.com/lora-module/) with the open firmware.

## Documentation
